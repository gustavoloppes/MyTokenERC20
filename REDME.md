# MyToken - ERC-20 Token Contract

MyToken is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token smart contract that allows you to create and manage your own cryptocurrency. This contract follows the ERC-20 standard, making it compatible with various wallets and decentralized applications (DApps).

## Getting Started

To get started with MyToken, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone `
2. Install dependencies if applicable.
3. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network using tools like Remix or Truffle.

## Usage

MyToken can be used for various purposes, such as:

- Creating your own cryptocurrency.
- Testing token transfers and smart contract interactions.
- Learning about ERC-20 token standards and Solidity.

## Configuration

This project is designed to work with the Ganache local blockchain development environment. Ganache provides a private Ethereum network ideal for testing and development purposes.

### Getting Ganache

If you don't already have Ganache installed, you can download it from [the official website](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

### MetaMask Wallet Integration

To interact with the MyToken contract on your local Ganache network, you'll need to configure MetaMask to connect to Ganache. Here's how:

1. Install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/).
2. Open MetaMask and create or import an Ethereum wallet.
3. Configure MetaMask to connect to Ganache using the Ganache RPC server URL.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

1. Use Remix or a development environment of your choice to compile the contract.
2. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network, such as the Ropsten or mainnet.
